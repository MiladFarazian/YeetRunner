Worked with student **Ian A**. He made a fast-paced in the span of a week, of which I assisted him a lot to work with moving backgrounds, phyics, and adding images. Utilized time as means of score and had GameState variables to signal a game over. **The game has its bugs, given it was made within a week, but I'm glad I was able to teach all of these cool techniques**
